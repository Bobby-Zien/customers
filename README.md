# customers

From team assignment doc: "The customers resource is a representation of the customer accounts of the 
eCommerce site. At a minimum it should have the customer’s first and last name along with some customer 
id that can be used as a key for uniquely identifying them. It may even have a userid and password. 
It’s up to you. Customers also have at least one address. You will need to implement a subordinate
REST API to store one or more addresses (e.g., /customers/{id}/addresses)"
